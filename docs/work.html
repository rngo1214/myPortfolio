                <p>This is a webapp created in 36 hours during the 5th Annual Hacks For Humanity in 2018. This was my introduction to modern web development, and as such, I learned many things about it in a short span of time. Due to not knowing much at the time of the hackathon, my only real contributions were to the frontend &#40;not the majority of the JavaScript, however&#41; and to the frontend-backend communication. My most relevant addition was using jQuery AJAX calls to request information from the backend. I then parsed the JSON files that came back in order to display information on the website in a dynamic way.</p>

                <p>This was the first project I undertook that was of significant scope &#40;i.e. a fully featured application with a GUI&#41; In my spare time I like to browse Reddit more frequently than I would like to admit, and due to the amount of time I spent, I discovered my preferences in browsing that were left unfulfilled. So, I thought, why not try to build those features myself, in my own app? At the time of writing this, the app is still a work in progress, but along the way I have taught myself many things about Android app development. I would like for this app to be published on the Google Play store one day, but as of right now, it only lives on Github and my phone.</p>

                <p>I made this project with a partner in High School, for my AP Computer Science A class. In the class we had learned about the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming. To demonstrate our knowledge of it, we were tasked to create two different games with the same root class. This was also my first introduction to Github and the idea of version control, as well as collaboration with another person.</p>
